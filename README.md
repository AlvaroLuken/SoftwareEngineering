# This is my attempt at creating a README.md file from my Mac terminal using Git

- I found the above-linked website (or collection of writings) VERY interesting as it is the account of an engineer and his first experiences
working with open source projects. He gives proper tribute to Linus Torvalds and gives some background as to why Linus is such a key figure in
the history of programming software - it wasn't Linus's great coding ability (though, the author acknowledges Linus is a wizard of coding) that
made Linux succeed (ie. be built at such an incredible pace and at such high quality), but Linus's recognition of the power of community. Linus
knew how to maximize efficiency of building a product by harvesting communities. The point on motivating communities to contribute back into the 
development of a product struck home for me, as I run many community-based Facebook changes and I try to implement the same methods to keep them 
active and contributing.

- The author also outlines the difference between a Cathderal model of building versus that of a Bazaar. These were supposed to be metaphors for 
closed-source vs open-source but they can also be direct parallels to the waterfall and agile models that we have studied in class.

- I think this article is interesting as well and I like his comparison of open source projects to a bazaar. I like the idea of less rigidity and more collaboration with different people in the open source style, although I've never took part in that type of development. I think the pros of open source developement are interesting as well - of using users who may be developers as a way to improve the project.
